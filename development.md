# DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES (Engineering Add-On)

This file supplements the base resume only when:
- resume-mode = DEV_ONLY
- resume-mode = INFRA_PLUS_DEV (Hybrid)

It contains engineering-focused skills and capabilities that
should enhance the technical depth of the resume without including
domain-specific EdTech content.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEERING & AUTOMATION
- API-driven automation and workflow orchestration  
- Backend logic development for system integrations  
- Automated diagnostics and remediation pipelines  
- CI/CD engineering using GitHub Actions  
- Scripted solutions using JavaScript, Python, and Shell  
- Data pipeline automation for logs, analytics, and ETL-style flows  

----------------------------------------------------
## PLATFORM & BACKEND ENGINEERING
- Building modular backend components and reusable service utilities  
- Designing API schemas and integrating service endpoints  
- Implementing authentication, logging, storage, and RBAC models  
- Managing data models, indexing, query tuning, and performance optimization  
- Engineering serverless functions and event-driven automation  

----------------------------------------------------
## FRONTEND ENGINEERING (Light)
- Component-driven UI development using HTML, JS, Tailwind  
- State-driven rendering patterns and modular UI flows  
- User-centric interface creation for operational tools and dashboards  

----------------------------------------------------
## CLOUD, SRE & OBSERVABILITY ENGINEERING
- Azure, AWS, and GCP engineering fundamentals  
- Hands-on observability tooling: Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus  
- Distributed tracing, root-cause diagnostics, telemetry correlation  
- Designing alert hygiene, SLO-based monitoring, and operational dashboards  
- Implementing reliability improvements across distributed systems  

----------------------------------------------------
## DEVOPS & SYSTEM AUTOMATION
- Infrastructure-as-Code mindset using automation tools  
- Build, release, and deploy pipelines (GitHub Actions CI/CD)  
- Automated documentation and configuration syncing  
- Environment orchestration and zero-touch promotion workflows  

----------------------------------------------------
## ENGINEERING COLLABORATION & PRACTICES
- Working with architects, product managers, and engineering teams  
- Driving design discussions and making technology trade-offs  
- Writing maintainable code, reusable modules, and structured documentation  
- Applying system-thinking approaches for scalable engineering  

----------------------------------------------------
## TECHNICAL TOOLKIT (General)
- JavaScript, Python, Shell scripting  
- GitHub Actions, Supabase API tooling, CI/CD workflows  
- Cloud-native services (Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, GCP equivalents)  
- Logging: Supabase logs, Datadog logs, centralized pipelines  
- Dashboards, metrics, service health analytics  

----------------------------------------------------
