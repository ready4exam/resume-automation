[REVIEW]
- **Missing Keywords / ATS Alignment Issues:** The resume lacks the most critical keyword phrases from the job description: "IT reseller," "distribution landscape," and "Inside Sales." All experience is from the IT services/consulting side (a consumer of technology), not the reseller/distribution side (a seller of technology), which is a fundamental mismatch with the core requirement.
- **Leadership Gaps:** The resume fails to demonstrate experience leading a commercial, revenue-generating business unit with full P&L responsibility. The experience cited is managing an operational expenditure (OPEX) budget, which is fundamentally different from managing top-line revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and bottom-line profit (EBIT) as required.
- **Generic Text:** The skill "IT Reseller & Distribution Landscape" is listed in the Core Skills but is not substantiated by any role in the Experience section, making it an unsubstantiated claim.
- **Leadership Gaps:** There is no evidence of leading or overseeing core functions mentioned in the job description, such as "Procurement" and "Logistics" teams within a commercial sourcing context. The experience is focused on internal IT asset management, not a commercial supply chain.
- **ATS Alignment Issues:** The current role at PwC is listed with a future start date ("Sep 2024 – Present"). This is a major clarity issue that can be misinterpreted by both ATS and human reviewers as misleading.
- **No Outcomes:** The Kyndryl role mentions directing operations for "100,000+ mission-critical IT assets" but fails to provide any specific outcome related to efficiency, cost savings, or service improvement.
- **Missing Keywords:** The resume lacks any mention of managing "pricing strategy" or partner-specific commercial activities like rebates or go-to-market funds, which are central to a technology sourcing business.
- **Weak Verbs:** The Kyndryl description uses the phrase "Demonstrated deep understanding of..." which is a weak, passive claim. It should be replaced with an action verb describing a specific accomplishment, such as "Led" or "Architected."
- **Repetition:** The theme of "collaboration with European & North American teams" is mentioned multiple times (Summary, PwC, IBM) without providing distinct, impactful outcomes for each instance, slightly diluting its effect.
