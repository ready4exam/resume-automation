[REVIEW]
- **Missing alignment between summary and JD:** The summary’s final line targets the wrong role ("Director Architecture") instead of the advertised "Lead Solution Architect." This shows a lack of attention to detail and undermines the customization.
- **Missing keywords for Agentic AI / SRE / Cloud / FinOps / Leadership:** The resume critically lacks depth in required AWS expertise. It lists an entry-level "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner" certification which is misaligned with a senior architect role, and it fails to mention specific AWS services crucial for data/batch processing (e.g., Glue, EMR, Lambda, Step Functions). Furthermore, "C# (.NET)" proficiency, a stated requirement, is completely missing.
- **Weak bullets lacking measurable impact:** Several experience bullets are weak, stating actions without results. For example, "Championed the design and implementation of an Agentic AI system... improving platform reliability" lacks the "by how much?" A senior leader's resume should quantify impact (e.g., reduced MTTR by X%, decreased P1 incidents by Y%).
- **Tone mismatches (seniority not reflected):** The entry-level AWS certification creates a significant tone mismatch. For a Lead Architect with 21 years of experience, this suggests a superficial, not a deep, hands-on understanding of the core cloud platform required for the role, contradicting the claimed seniority.
- **Sections too long, vague, or irrelevant:** The experience from 2003-2013 (Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Mainstay) is overly detailed on legacy ITSM, ITIL, and on-prem monitoring tools. This space should be condensed to focus on the more recent and relevant cloud and architectural achievements.
- **Any ATS risks:** The resume contains multiple ATS risks: 1) Non-standard section tags like `[SUMMARY]` may not parse correctly. 2) The critical lack of specific AWS service keywords will likely cause the resume to be down-ranked. 3) The employment date at PwC ("Sep 2024 – Present") is an impossible future date, which is a major error that will be flagged by both automated systems and human reviewers.
- **Whether PROJECTS are relevant or should be suppressed:** The PROJECTS section is highly relevant and should be retained. It is the strongest part of the resume for demonstrating current, hands-on skills in Agentic AI, Python data pipelines, and serverless architecture, directly addressing the forward-looking aspects of the job description.
- **Whether SUMMARY needs a final “fit for role” line:** A concluding "fit for role" sentence is effective, but the current one must be rewritten to use the exact job title ("Lead Solution Architect") to show genuine interest and precision.
