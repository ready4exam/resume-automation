[REVIEW]
- **Overall Alignment:** The candidate is an exceptionally strong fit for this role. With over 20 years of experience, a Master's degree, and deep, hands-on expertise in AI/GenAI platforms, cloud architecture, and global operational leadership, they directly address almost all major accountabilities and minimum requirements. The resume clearly demonstrates a strategic mindset, technical depth, and proven track record in complex, regulated environments.

- **Strengths against Major Accountabilities:**
    - **AI/GenAI Vision & Strategy:** Explicitly stated in the summary and core skills ("AI/GenAI Platform Strategy & Vision"). The PwC role in "IT Strategy & FinOps Advisor" and "delivering comprehensive platform modernization roadmaps" combined with the AI/GenAI projects (Agentic AI, custom GPTs) demonstrate a clear ability to define and execute technology vision.
    - **Platform Evaluation & Scaling:** Direct experience in "establishing and scaling advanced technology platforms." The PwC role involves "engineered a custom AI-driven automation framework and GPT," Kyndryl includes "developed an Agentic AI system," and both "Ready4Industry" and "Ready4Exam" projects showcase practical implementation and engineering on AWS/Azure, aligning perfectly with integrating and scaling AI platforms.
    - **Governance & ROI:** Strong evidence from PwC ("FinOps initiatives, developing hybrid-cloud cost dashboards... demonstrated tangible ROI"), IBM ("Managed $25M annual OPEX, achieving $8M in savings," "standardizing ITIL-based frameworks"), and Wipro ("Introduced standardized operating procedures," "Led Problem and Change Management... ensuring robust governance"). This covers both financial and operational governance.
    - **Product Mindset & Agile for PoCs/MVPs:** "Fostering a product mindset" and "Agile & DevSecOps Methodologies" are core skills. The AI projects (Ready4Industry, Ready4Exam) are essentially PoCs/MVPs that were developed, demonstrating the ability to take new ideas through to implementation and scale.
    - **Communication & Stakeholder Engagement:** Explicitly stated in minimum requirements ("Proven communication skills in a global matrix organization... excellent presentation skills"). The "Cultivated strong relationships with global leadership" (PwC) and "Trained L1/L2 engineers... authored comprehensive SOP documentation" (Mainstay) showcase capability in stakeholder management and knowledge transfer.
    - **Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing:** Directly addressed by "Cross-functional Team Leadership" and "leading large, cross-functional teams in a global matrix environment." The IBM experience "Built and scaled the Capacity Management Center of Excellence from 10 to 250 members across 5 countries" is a strong indicator of fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
    - **Objectives & Risk Governance:** Wipro's "Led Problem and Change Management, driving Root Cause Analysis, implementing risk-controlled changes, chairing Change Advisory Boards (CAB), and ensuring robust governance" clearly demonstrates experience in managing priorities and risks with a strategic foresight.
    - **Industry Trends & Partnerships:** The depth of technical skills in AI/GenAI (LLMs, FMs, SLMs, PyTorch, Mistral) and the creation of custom AI solutions (Agentic AI, GPTs) prove engagement with industry trends. The PwC role as a "Strategic Advisor" implies collaboration and understanding of technology partnerships.
    - **Data Management for AI:** "Data Governance & Data Quality for AI" is a core skill, supported by "Implemented robust data pipeline automation" in projects and "Data Collection & Preparation, MLOps Pipelines" in technical skills.
    - **Operationalizing AI/GenAI Platform Support:** Extensive experience in "Global Service Reliability Engineering & Platform Operations" (Kyndryl), "enhancing reliability, performance, and capacity management." The Tech Mahindra role ("Deployed and managed enterprise monitoring tools") and the technical skills in observability tools are highly relevant.
    - **Compliance & Security:** Proven experience with "Regulatory Compliance & Risk Management." The PwC role specifically mentions "compliance with NIST and ITIL standards" and "Engineered a custom AI-driven automation framework and GPT for ITSM operations and security reasoning," which directly aligns with implementing robust data protection and supporting security audits.

- **Strengths against Minimum Requirements:**
    - **Education:** Exceeds with a Master's degree and a PGP in Project Management.
    - **Experience:** Meets the "20+ years" requirement with approximately 21.5 years.
    - **AI/GenAI Deep Knowledge:** Exceptional, with hands-on project experience in building custom GPTs, Agentic AI, and expertise listed across LLMs, FMs, SLMs, PyTorch, Mistral.
    - **Cloud Architecting AI/GenAI Solutions:** Strong, with certifications (Azure Solutions Architect Expert, AWS Cloud Practitioner) and project experience on AWS/Azure.
    - **NLP, FMs, LLMs, SLMs & APIs:** Demonstrates direct experience with custom GPTs, PyTorch, Mistral, and lists these as technical skills, alongside API integration.
    - **ML/ML Ops/LLM Ops Lifecycle:** Explicitly listed as a core skill and technical skill, supported by project experience in data pipeline automation for continuous learning.
    - **Software Development (Agile/DevSecOps):** Strong, with "Software Engineering & Automation (Python, JavaScript)" as a core skill and extensive DevSecOps tools listed.
    - **Pharma Regulatory & Compliance (Desirable):** While "Pharma" isn't explicitly mentioned, "regulated sectors like Healthcare and BFSI" and direct experience with "Avance Health" and "NHS UK" is highly relevant and indicates an understanding of complex compliance environments applicable to pharma.
    - **Strong Delivery & Communication:** Evident from multiple global leadership roles, program management, and explicit mention of communication skills.
    - **Leading Cross-functional Teams:** Clearly demonstrated through experience at IBM ("scaled the Capacity Management Center of Excellence from 10 to 250 members across 5 countries") and other leadership roles.

- **Minor Considerations/Potential Questions (Not Weaknesses):**
    - The resume strongly covers "Healthcare" but doesn't explicitly name "Pharma" regulatory experience. While highly transferable, this might be a point for clarification in an interview. However, the depth of compliance experience in regulated sectors makes this a minor point.

- **Conclusion:** The candidate presents an outstanding profile for the Head AI Platform role. Their experience aligns almost perfectly with the job description's strategic, technical, and leadership requirements, with a strong emphasis on AI/GenAI, operational excellence, and navigating complex organizational structures.
