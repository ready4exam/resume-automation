[REVIEW]
- **Exceptional Alignment with Strategic Leadership & Experience Requirements:** The resume significantly exceeds the 10+ years of experience requirement, showcasing 21+ years in strategic planning, technology leadership, and operational excellence, with multiple senior leadership roles (Associate Director, Senior Manager) well over the 5-year threshold. This demonstrates a robust foundation for the Director, Strategy & Operations role.

- **Strong Expertise in Data and AI Strategy Execution & Operationalization:** Keshav explicitly highlights "developing and executing cohesive Data and AI Strategy." The experience includes "engineering and implementing an AI-driven automation framework," "developing an Agentic AI system for autonomous AIOps response," "integrating AI-driven insights" into operations, and leading AI-powered platform projects. This directly addresses the job description's focus on enterprise Data and AI strategy, effective execution, and smooth operationalization into business functions.

- **Proven Cross-functional Leadership & Collaboration:** The resume clearly states "fostering cross-functional collaboration across engineering, AI, analytics, and product teams" and "cultivated strong relationships with global leadership and cross-functional teams to deliver critical platform modernization roadmaps and digital transformation objectives." This directly aligns with the requirement to collaborate with various technical and business leaders to prioritize initiatives and meet broader digital transformation objectives.

- **Robust Governance and Risk Management Frameworks:** Keshav's experience with "implementing robust governance frameworks," leading "strategic advisory engagements... aligned with NIST and ITIL," and "standardizing ITIL-based frameworks for end-to-end capacity management" is a strong match. Direct experience in "Problem and Change Management, driving Root Cause Analysis, implementing risk-controlled changes, chairing Change Advisory Boards, and ensuring strong governance" showcases a deep understanding of risk mitigation and adherence to delivery timelines and budgets. Certifications in ITIL v3 and COBIT 4.1 further reinforce this strength.

- **Demonstrated Business Process Management & Performance Optimization:** The resume provides excellent examples of "Business Process Reengineering & Optimization," including an "AI-driven automation framework, significantly reducing repeat failures by 60%," and "modernizing contact center operations by integrating AI-driven insights, accelerating response times and improving overall business process efficiency." Experience with "performance dashboards" and "budget optimization" aligns with tracking performance, recommending adjustments, and ensuring business value.

- **Excellent Vendor Strategy & Relationship Management:** Keshav exhibits strong experience in this area, including "orchestrating a $30M+ vendor displacement program" to enhance agility and reduce costs, and "achieving $8M in savings through strategic automation, vendor renegotiation, and license optimization." This directly addresses the need for developing a vendor strategy, managing relationships, and participating in negotiations.

- **Solid Foundation in Data Culture Leadership & Talent Nurturing:** The experience of "building and scaling the Capacity Management Center of Excellence from 10 to 250 members across 5 countries, fostering a culture of innovation and skill development" directly supports the requirement to foster innovation, learning, and continuous improvement. The creation and delivery of "training programs for L1/L2 engineers and authored Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documentation, fostering knowledge sharing and skill development" aligns with building data literacy and skill sets.

- **Strong Implicit Stakeholder Management & Communication:** While not explicitly stating "preparing regular progress updates for executive leadership," the resume's numerous examples of leading global teams, managing large budgets, and interacting with global leadership and cross-functional teams strongly imply robust stakeholder management and communication skills essential for this role. The mention of "project transparency" further supports this.

- **Opportunity to Emphasize Data Quality, Privacy, and Compliance:** While strong in overall governance, the resume could more explicitly highlight specific contributions or responsibilities related to "maintaining data quality, privacy, and compliance standards across all enterprise data assets" to fully align with this specific job description point.
