[REVIEW]
- **Fatal Domain Mismatch:** The resume is entirely focused on IT Infrastructure and Technology Service Management (ITSM, AIOps, FinOps, data centers), whereas the role is for Life, Annuities & Retirement (LAR) **business process operations** (underwriting support, policy admin, claims). There is no demonstrated experience in the core LAR domain.
- **Missing Keywords & ATS Failure:** The resume lacks critical keywords and will likely fail ATS screening. Missing terms include: Life Insurance, Annuities, Retirement, policy administration, underwriting, claims, commissions, LOMA, ALMI, FLMI, GLBA, ERISA, NIGO, TAT (Turnaround Time), and AHT (Average Handle Time).
- **Leadership Scale Gap:** The required leadership experience is for 800+ FTEs. The resume's largest quantifiable achievement is scaling a team to 250+ members, which is less than a third of the required span of control.
- **Incorrect P&L Experience:** The job requires ownership of a $50M+ client-facing revenue P&L. The resume cites management of a $25M internal IT OPEX budget, which is fundamentally different and does not demonstrate experience with revenue growth, margins, or commercial constructs like gain-sharing.
- **No Relevant Metrics:** The metrics provided ($8M savings from software licenses, 60% reduction in repeat service failures) are IT-focused. The resume is void of essential LAR operations metrics such as SLA attainment (TAT, Accuracy), contact center KPIs (FCR, AHT, CSAT/NPS), or business outcomes (STP%, NIGO reduction).
- **Misaligned Transformation Experience:** While "GenAI" and "Automation" are mentioned, the context is entirely for IT Operations (AIOps, proactive issue resolution for infrastructure). There is no evidence of applying these technologies to the specific LAR use cases required, such as underwriting triage, claims adjudication, or policy servicing automation.
- **Weak Solutioning Experience:** The JD requires leading RFI/RFP responses and designing full-scale operating models. The resume only claims "RFI/RFP Solutioning Support," which is a weaker, non-leadership contribution and lacks any evidence of authored wins.
- **Technology Stack Misalignment:** The resume lists a deep stack of IT infrastructure and monitoring tools (Azure, AWS, ScienceLogic, ServiceNow). It completely lacks familiarity with the required LAR platforms like policy admin systems (ALIP/VPAS) or contact center technologies (Genesys/NICE).
- **Missing Certifications and Education:** The role prefers LOMA ALMI/FLMI, Lean Six Sigma, and COPC certifications to demonstrate domain expertise. The candidate's certifications are all IT-centric (Azure, AWS, ITIL) and do not align with the business operations focus.
