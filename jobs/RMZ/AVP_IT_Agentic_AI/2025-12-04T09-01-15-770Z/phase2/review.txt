[REVIEW]
- Reframe your professional identity. The job is for a product leader who uses technology. Your resume reads as a technology/service delivery leader who has recently adopted product language. Revise your summary and experience to lead with "AI Product Leader," focusing on market needs, user-centric design, and commercial impact first, and technology second.
- The start date for PwC ("Sep 2024 – Present") is a critical error. It makes your accomplishments in that role seem fabricated as they are written in the past tense. Correct this immediately. If the role is starting in the future, it should not be listed under "Experience" with past-tense achievements.
- Your experience bullets are achievement-oriented but need to be more "product-centric." For example, instead of "Championed the design and implementation of an Agentic AI system," rephrase to "Owned the product lifecycle of an Agentic AI system, from business case and roadmap definition to delivery and user adoption, resulting in improved response times." This explicitly ties your actions to the product management process mentioned in the JD.
- Your "Agentic AI for Hybrid-Cloud FinOps" project is excellent but needs a quantifiable business outcome. The JD emphasizes "impact measurement" and "business KPIs." Add a metric, such as "Resulted in a 15% reduction in cloud spend anomalies" or "Cut down manual FinOps reporting time by 80%."
- Create a second project to showcase another concrete product example. Convert your "AI-driven automation product that reduced repeat service failures by 60%" from your PwC experience into a full project description. Detail the problem, the agentic/RAG solution you architected, and the direct business impact. This provides more evidence of hands-on product leadership.
- The job description specifically calls out "Capital Markets, Construction Management" as an advantage. Your resume has no mention of these domains. If you have any exposure, even through a minor project or client engagement at PwC or Wipro, add a bullet point to highlight it. Example: "Provided ITSM consulting for a leading capital markets firm, identifying opportunities for process automation."
- The "Core Skills" section is strong but can be consolidated. Merge "End-to-End Product Lifecycle Management" with "AI Product Strategy & Roadmapping" to create a more powerful, single concept like "End-to-End AI Product Leadership (Strategy, Roadmap, Lifecycle)." This makes it punchier and less like a list.
