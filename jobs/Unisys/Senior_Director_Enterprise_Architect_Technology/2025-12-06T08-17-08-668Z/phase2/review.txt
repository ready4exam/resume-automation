[REVIEW]
- Missing alignment between summary and JD: The summary contains a critical error, explicitly mentioning a different company ("Unisys"), which signals a lack of attention to detail and is an immediate disqualifier. Additionally, the JD focuses on leadership within a product division, while the resume's experience is heavily weighted towards IT services, consulting, and SRE for external clients, not internal product engineering leadership.
- Missing keywords for Agentic AI / SRE / Cloud / FinOps / Leadership: The resume effectively includes keywords for Agentic AI, SRE, Cloud, and FinOps. However, the "Leadership" narrative is misaligned; it demonstrates leadership in service delivery and operations, but lacks explicit experience leading product engineering teams of architects and developers as required by the JD.
- Weak bullets lacking measurable impact: Several bullets describe activities without outcomes. For instance, "Collaborated with executive leadership...to deliver...roadmaps" and "Provided global delivery leadership..." are vague and lack metrics on the business impact, scale, or success of these initiatives.
- Tone mismatches (seniority not reflected): The detailed, tactical descriptions of early career roles (2003-2010) dilute the executive-level narrative. They should be condensed to focus on the more recent, strategic leadership experience.
- Sections too long, vague, or irrelevant: The EXPERIENCE section is too long. Roles pre-2014 are overly detailed and less relevant to the strategic nature of the target position; they should be significantly summarized.
- Any ATS risks: The explicit mention of "Unisys" in the summary is a major risk, as it's a mismatch with the target company name and will be flagged by any human screener.
- Whether PROJECTS are relevant or should be suppressed: The PROJECTS are technologically relevant, showcasing modern skills in AI and microservices. However, for this seniority level, they risk positioning the candidate as too "hands-on." They should be reframed to emphasize leadership and architectural vision rather than individual development contributions.
- Whether SUMMARY needs a final “fit for role” line: The summary includes a "fit for role" line but it is for the wrong company. This must be removed and replaced with a line tailored specifically to this job description, connecting his strategic leadership and modernization experience to the needs of the product division.
