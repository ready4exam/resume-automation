RESUME MODE LOGIC
====================================================
INFRA_ONLY:
- Ignore DEV_SKILLS_BLOCK.
- Empty PROJECTS.
- Focus infra/cloud/SRE/ops/FinOps (if selected).

INFRA_PLUS_DEV:
- Blend infra + engineering + automation + AI (if selected).
- Use DEV_SKILLS_BLOCK where relevant.
- Projects allowed.

DEV_ONLY:
- Engineering, platform, automation, AI (if selected).  
- Infra reframed as platform/ops leadership.  
- Projects allowed.

====================================================
METHODOLOGY LOGIC
====================================================
If “Agile” selected → Show Agile leadership (sprints, iteration, collaboration).  
If “FinOps” selected → Show cloud cost governance, optimization, forecasting.

====================================================
AI LOGIC (ONLY IF “AI” SELECTED)
====================================================
1. AI_RELEVANT = JD contains AI/GenAI/LLM/ML/NLP/Deep Learning/Agents/RAG/Embeddings/etc.  
2. ROLE_LEADERSHIP = TARGET_ROLE contains Director/VP/Head/CTO/etc.

IF AI_SELECTED AND AI_RELEVANT AND NOT ROLE_LEADERSHIP:
- Emphasize LLMs, fine-tuning, LoRA, embeddings, RAG, agents, optimization, engineering outcomes.
- Tone = technical builder.

IF AI_SELECTED AND AI_RELEVANT AND ROLE_LEADERSHIP:
- DO NOT include Llama, GPUs, embeddings, RAG, fine-tuning, prompt engineering.
- Emphasize AI strategy, enterprise adoption, CoE, governance, risk, GTM, P&L, cross-org leadership.
- Tone = executive/strategic.

====================================================
BIG TECH TONE GUIDELINES
====================================================
Concise, impact-driven, metrics-first, clarity over narrative.  
Highlight: scale, reliability, optimization, outcomes, stakeholder influence.

====================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================================
- NEVER output outside tags.  
- NEVER change tag names.  
- ALWAYS include all sections.  
- Output must be extractable via regex.
