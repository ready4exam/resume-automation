# GOOGLE_ENGINEERING_REFERENCE_TEMPLATE
# (REFERENCE + PROJECTS + TOOLSET — NOT FOR DIRECT INSERTION)

This file contains:
1. Big-tech engineering tone/style reference  
2. Detailed tools & technologies reference  
3. My EdTech projects (to insert ONLY in hybrid/dev resume modes)  

The content in Sections 1 & 2 MUST NEVER be copied into the resume.  
Only Section 3 MAY be included when resume-mode = INFRA_PLUS_DEVELOPMENT or DEVELOPMENT_ONLY.

# SECTION 1 — BIG-TECH ENGINEERING STYLE (REFERENCE ONLY — DO NOT COPY)

Use these principles ONLY to influence the rewriting of my real experience.

## Tone Characteristics
- Engineering-first, impact-driven language  
- Ownership of distributed systems, automation pipelines, reliability initiatives  
- Strong SRE mindset: observability, diagnostics, RCA, MTTR improvements  
- Promote engineering verbs: architected, engineered, optimized, automated, scaled  

## Resume Action Structure (Reference Only)
Problem → Engineering Action → Tools Used → Quantified Impact

## Allowed Style Themes
(Do NOT copy these; use only for tone guidance)

- Improve platform reliability  
- Reduce MTTR through automated diagnostics  
- Build scalable automation pipelines  
- Enhance observability and monitoring maturity  
- Lead cross-functional architecture discussions  
- Engineer distributed system improvements

# SECTION 2 — TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES (REFERENCE ONLY — DO NOT INSERT)

These tools reflect the ecosystems used in my Google-style engineering resume (:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}).  
They MUST NOT be inserted directly, but Gemini may *infer* language/competencies stylistically.

## Cloud Platforms
- **GCP:** Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, BigQuery  
- **AWS:** EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch  
- **Azure:** VMs, Functions, Monitor  

## Observability & Monitoring
- Datadog  
- New Relic  
- Prometheus  
- Distributed tracing  
- Log correlation & diagnostics  

## Automation & CI/CD
- GitHub Actions  
- Workflow engines  
- API-driven automation  
- Auto-remediation workflows  
- Containerized deployment patterns  

## Programming / Scripting
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- PowerShell  
- Shell scripting  

## Troubleshooting & SRE Tools
- SQL debugging  
- BigQuery  
- Log pipelines  
- Incident management tooling  
- Error budget thinking  
- Alert hygiene & reduction engineering  

## SaaS / Platform Engineering
- Supabase (auth, storage, APIs, logs)  
- Vercel deployments  
- Webhook & API lifecycle debugging  
- Backend workflow orchestration  

## Data & Analytics Engineering
- ETL-like processing  
- Table generation automation  
- Student/usage telemetry modeling (reference only)  
- Pipeline ingestion & transformation  

These should help Gemini emulate **FAANG-style technical depth**, without copying content.

# SECTION 3 — PROJECTS (CAN BE INSERTED WHEN MODE = HYBRID OR DEV)

Below are my EdTech / AI Product Engineering projects.  
They SHOULD appear in the final resume when:

- resume-mode = INFRA_PLUS_DEVELOPMENT  
- resume-mode = DEVELOPMENT_ONLY  

They MUST NOT appear when:
- resume-mode = INFRA_ONLY  
- big-tech resume where JD does not ask for projects  
- applying strictly for enterprise IT/SRE roles (unless asked)

Insert this as: **Projects & Independent Work**

## Project: READY4EXAM — AI Academic Intelligence Platform

### Overview
Designed and engineered an end-to-end academic intelligence platform serving Class 6–12 learners.

### Key Engineering Contributions
- Built AI-driven difficulty scoring, mastery models, syllabus mapping, and performance analytics engines.
- Developed full-stack quiz system, question automation workflows, and curriculum ingestion modules.
- Designed dashboards for students, teachers, and leadership with real-time academic insights.
- Engineered Supabase-backed APIs, data pipelines, schema design, and observability workflows.
- Automated content deployments using GitHub Actions with zero-manual-touch operations.

---

## Project: READY4INDUSTRY — Career Guidance & Stream Selection Platform

### Overview
Architected psychometric & competency-driven system for Class 11 stream selection and career guidance.

### Key Engineering Contributions
- Developed Aptitude–Interest–Personality scoring engines and competency alignment matrix.
- Built career pathway models with industry mapping, salary forecasting, and AI recommendations.
- Designed multi-role UI/UX flows for students, parents, and counselors.
- Automated evaluation logic, recommendation engines, and reporting pipelines.

# SECTION 4 — USAGE RULES (IMPORTANT)

## When to Include Projects
- INFRA_PLUS_DEVELOPMENT → YES  
- DEVELOPMENT_ONLY → YES  
- INFRA_ONLY → NO  
- Google/Microsoft/Amazon → Only if JD values product/AI/project engineering  
- If user says: “Include projects” → ALWAYS include  

## When to Use Sections 1 & 2
- ONLY as style and tone guidance  
- NEVER copy any content directly  
- NEVER replace enterprise roles
